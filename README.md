Testimonial 


-   Be authentic. Use your own words and voice to describe your experience.

-   Be specific. Include details about what you did, how you did it, and what results you achieved.

-   Be concise. Keep your testimonial short and to the point. Avoid unnecessary words or jargon.

-   Be positive. Focus on the benefits and value you received from the product or service.  Highlight how it solved your problem or improved your situation.

Here is an example of a testimonial quote for a portfolio:

    I hired [your name] to design my website and I couldnâ€™t be happier with the outcome. He was professional, creative, and responsive throughout the whole process. He listened to my needs and delivered a website that exceeded my expectations. It is user-friendly, attractive, and functional. It has helped me attract more clients and grow my business. I highly recommend [your name] to anyone looking for a talented and reliable web designer.

I hope this helps you write your own testimonial quote for your portfolio. If you need more assistance, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š

    For a graphic designer: What did you like most about the design [your name] created for you?
    For a writer: How did [your name]'s writing style and tone match your brand voice and audience?
    For a photographer: How did [your name] capture the essence and emotion of your special moment?
    For a coach: How did [your name] help you overcome your challenges and achieve your desired outcomes?

To write a good testimonial prompt, you should follow these tips12:

    Be specific. Ask about a particular aspect of your work, such as the quality, the process, or the results.
    Be open-ended. Avoid yes or no questions that limit the response. Instead, use words like how, what, or why to elicit more details and feedback.
    Be positive. Frame your prompt in a way that highlights the benefits and value of your work. Avoid negative or leading questions that might influence the response.
    Be concise. Keep your prompt short and simple. Donâ€™t overwhelm your customers with too many questions or too much information.

I hope this helps you write your own testimonial prompt for your portfolio. If you need more assistance, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š
